## Problem 
Participating in hackathons often involves the hassle of obtaining testnet tokens, leading to challenges such as latency. Last-minute bounty additions,also means late-night token distribution, and the absence of designated individuals for distribution can sometimes hurt your project.
This results in stress and time loss for hackers, hindering their focus on the actual competition.
## Solution 
To address these challenges, we introduce FaucETH, a platform designed to streamline the process of obtaining and distributing testnet tokens during hackathons. This solution aims to provide both event organizers and participants with a user-friendly pool where they can efficiently manage testnet tokens.

## Pain Points
- **Latency:** Obtaining testnet tokens can be time-consuming, causing delays and hindering the hackers' ability to start working promptly.

- **Last-minute Bounty Addition:** Late-night or last-minute bounty additions create additional stress especially if bounties representatives go to sleep!

- **Distribution Issues:** Lack of a streamlined process for requesting and receiving tokens, especially during non-standard hours, leads to confusion and delays.

## FaucETH Solution
- **Purpose:** FaucETH addresses the challenges faced by hackathon participants in acquiring testnet tokens, ensuring a smoother experience.

- **Platform Functionality:** The platform serves as a pool where event organizers can add testnet tokens, and approved hackers can withdraw them effortlessly.

## How FaucETH Works
- **Event Creation:** Event organizers create a new event on the platform and choose the EVM chains they want to include in the pool.

- **Token Distribution:** Sponsors receive a unique code and use it to send testnet tokens to a designated pool. This ensures a secure and straightforward method for sponsors to contribute to the token pool.

- **Hacker Whitelisting:** Approved hackers' wallets are whitelisted on the platform. Whitelisted hackers can smoothly pull testnet funds from the pool.

- **Accessibility and Availability:** The platform ensures 24/7 availability for token withdrawal, eliminating the issues associated with late-night or last-minute token needs.

## Benefits
- **Time Efficiency:** Streamlined processes reduce the time spent on obtaining testnet tokens, allowing hackers to focus on their projects.
